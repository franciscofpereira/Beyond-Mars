## Configuration

- Make sure you have Java installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Java from the official website.

Open a terminal on the project's directory and type the following command to execute the assembly simulator:
```text
java -jar simulador-1-5-2023.jar
```
Once the simulator is opened, load the circuit file (`projeto36.cir`) and the source code (`projeto36.asm`). Both files are in the `src` directory.

On the assembly simulator application:

 - Open the `Media Center` component on the circuit to view the display.
 - Open the `Keyboard` component on the circuit to view the keyboard. 
 - Open the `Energy Display` component on the circuit to view the spaceship's energy levels. 

Finally, under the `Simulation` tab, press play.

If you followed these steps accordingly your game should be running!
